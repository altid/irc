# Simple configuration file for ircfs
# Lines starting with "#" are considered comments, and will not be parsed
# Indented lines bind to the header above them, as if they were all written on the same line
# See below for examples


## Example on freenode
service=irc address=irc.freenode.net port=6667 nick=misch user=misch name=misch
	channel="#ubqt,#hwwm"


## Example server with password protected channels 
## Query factotum for password (requires factotum, such as plan9port's to be running)
#service=irc address=irc.test.net port=6667 nick=haffie user=haffie name=haffie !password?
#	channel=#test1,#test4
## Use password on channel
#	channel=#test2 password=Thisispw2
## Query factotum for channel password as well
#	channel=#test3 !password?


# {{.Name}} and {{.Message}} - https://godoc.org/text/template format specifiers
# These relate to the name of the sender, and the message they typed
# Colors are applied with the format of [color](thing to be colored)
# Standard color descriptors: [light] red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple, black, white, grey
# These should work on any conformant client, any additional colors will depend on clients
# This eventually will be something you can set at run time
