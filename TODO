TODO: aqwari.net/net/styx to export a 9p file tree when runtime.GOOS == "plan9" 
reader_plan9.go - NewReader makes "input" node in the file tree
writer_plan9.go - NewWriter makes regulare "file" node on file tree

server.go - abstract anything that touches an actual file away to the proper source directory (Event, for example)
files_plan9.go - CreateDirs, CreateChannel, Touch, DeleteChannel
 - this all bodes well for what we're doing

in files_plan9.go add in a var for a different flag, test if it works.
Touch is only in files.go
